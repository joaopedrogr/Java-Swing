# # Java Swing

## 📘 Description
The Java-Swing repository provides an in-depth exploration of building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java using Swing. This repository is ideal for developers who want to master Java's Swing framework through practical examples and exercises.

Key topics covered:

- Swing Basics: Learn how to create and manage GUI components.
- Event Handling: Understand how to handle user interactions.
- Observer Pattern: Explore the Observer design pattern in Java.
- GUI Design Best Practices: Implement efficient and maintainable GUI applications.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
The project is organized to facilitate learning and experimentation with Java Streams:

### Main Files
### src/
This folder contains Java source code covering key Swing concepts:

- Observador.java: Demonstrates a basic observer pattern implementation.

### Observer Pattern Implementation

- Patterns/Observer/AniversarioSurpresa.java: Implements an event-driven surprise birthday example.
- Patterns/Observer/EventoChegadaAniversariante.java: Defines the event when the birthday person arrives.
- Patterns/Observer/Namorada.java: Implements an observer reacting to the event.
- Patterns/Observer/ObservadorChegadaAniversariante.java: Observer interface for event handling.
- Patterns/Observer/Porteiro.java: Notifies observers when the birthday person arrives.
